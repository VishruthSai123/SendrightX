# Auto-Correct Filtering Test Instructions - IMPROVED VERSION ‚ú®

## What We Implemented

The auto-correct system now uses **intelligent selective filtering** instead of complete exclusion:

- **When auto-correct is ENABLED**: 
  - ‚úÖ User dictionary words are AVAILABLE for suggestions and glide typing
  - ‚úÖ User dictionary words are AVAILABLE for manual selection
  - ‚ùå User dictionary words are EXCLUDED from auto-commit/auto-correction only
  
- **When auto-correct is DISABLED**: 
  - ‚úÖ All words (both dictionary and user words) are available for suggestions, glide typing, and auto-commit

## üéØ Key Improvements

**‚úÖ Fixed Glide Typing**: User-saved words now work perfectly with glide typing even when auto-correct is enabled  
**‚úÖ Fixed Suggestions**: User words appear in suggestion bar when auto-correct is enabled  
**‚úÖ Smart Auto-Commit**: Only auto-commit behavior excludes user words to prevent bad corrections  
**‚úÖ Manual Selection**: Users can always manually select their saved words

## Testing Steps

### 1. First, add a misspelled word to user dictionary:
1. Type "updite" (misspelled version of "update")
2. When it appears in suggestions, long-press it
3. Select "Add to dictionary" to save it to your personal dictionary

### 2. Test with Auto-Correct DISABLED (default state):
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Typing ‚Üí Auto-correct ‚Üí Turn OFF auto-correct toggle
2. Type "updi" 
3. **Expected**: You should see "updite" (your saved misspelled word) in suggestions
4. Type "upda"
5. **Expected**: You should see both "update" (dictionary) and "updite" (user word) in suggestions
6. **Glide Typing**: Glide "updite" - should work perfectly
7. **Auto-commit**: May auto-commit to "updite" if it's the best match

### 3. Test with Auto-Correct ENABLED (improved behavior):
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Typing ‚Üí Auto-correct ‚Üí Turn ON auto-correct toggle
2. Type "updi"
3. **Expected**: You should see "updite" in suggestions (NOT filtered out anymore!)
4. Type "upda"
5. **Expected**: You should see both "update" and "updite" in suggestions
6. **Glide Typing**: Glide "updite" - should work perfectly ‚ú®
7. **Manual Selection**: Tap "updite" - should work perfectly ‚ú®
8. **Auto-commit**: Type "updi" and press space - should auto-correct to "update" (NOT "updite")

### 4. Verify Selective Filtering:
1. With auto-correct ON:
   - ‚úÖ User words appear in suggestions
   - ‚úÖ User words work with glide typing
   - ‚úÖ User words can be manually selected
   - ‚ùå User words are NOT auto-committed (preventing bad corrections)
2. With auto-correct OFF:
   - ‚úÖ Everything works as before

## Key Benefits of New Implementation

‚úÖ **Best of Both Worlds**: User words available for suggestions/glide typing, but excluded from auto-commit  
‚úÖ **Glide Typing Fixed**: No more broken glide typing for user-saved words  
‚úÖ **Manual Control**: Users can always manually select their saved words  
‚úÖ **Smart Auto-Correct**: Only auto-commits proper dictionary words, preventing saved typos from interfering  
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Auto-correct OFF behavior unchanged

## Technical Implementation

- **WordSuggestionCandidate**: Added `isFromUserDictionary` property to track word source
- **LatinLanguageProvider**: Always includes user words but marks them appropriately
- **NlpManager**: Auto-commit logic excludes user dictionary words when auto-correct is enabled
- **All Providers**: Updated to properly mark user vs dictionary words

This approach ensures users get the full functionality of their saved words while preventing accidentally saved misspellings from interfering with auto-corrections! üöÄ
