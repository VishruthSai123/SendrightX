# Auto-Correct Filtering Test Instructions - FINAL SOLUTION ‚ú®

## What We Implemented - FINAL

The auto-correct system now uses **intelligent selective filtering** with **dynamic refresh** to fix all issues:

- **When auto-correct is ENABLED**: 
  - ‚úÖ User dictionary words are AVAILABLE for suggestions and glide typing
  - ‚úÖ User dictionary words are AVAILABLE for manual selection  
  - ‚úÖ **GLIDE TYPING WORKS PERFECTLY** for user-saved words
  - ‚ùå User dictionary words are EXCLUDED from auto-commit/auto-correction only
  
- **When auto-correct is DISABLED**: 
  - ‚úÖ All words (both dictionary and user words) are available for suggestions, glide typing, and auto-commit

## üéØ Key Improvements - FINAL VERSION

**‚úÖ Fixed Glide Typing**: User-saved words now work PERFECTLY with glide typing even when auto-correct is enabled  
**‚úÖ Fixed Suggestions**: User words appear in suggestion bar when auto-correct is enabled  
**‚úÖ Smart Auto-Commit**: Only auto-commit behavior excludes user words to prevent bad corrections  
**‚úÖ Manual Selection**: Users can always manually select their saved words  
**‚úÖ Dynamic Refresh**: Toggle auto-correct instantly refreshes suggestions and glide typing behavior

## Testing Steps - UPDATED

2. When it appears in suggestions, long-press it
3. Select "Add to dictionary" to save it to your personal dictionary

### 2. Test with Auto-Correct DISABLED (default state):
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Typing ‚Üí Auto-correct ‚Üí Turn OFF auto-correct toggle
2. Type "updi" 
3. **Expected**: You should see "updite" (your saved misspelled word) in suggestions
4. Type "upda"
5. **Expected**: You should see both "update" (dictionary) and "updite" (user word) in suggestions
6. **Glide Typing**: Glide "updite" - should work perfectly
7. **Auto-commit**: May auto-commit to "updite" if it's the best match

### 3. Test with Auto-Correct ENABLED (FINAL improved behavior):
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Typing ‚Üí Auto-correct ‚Üí Turn ON auto-correct toggle
2. **IMMEDIATELY**: Suggestions and glide typing should refresh automatically ‚ö°
3. Type "updi"
4. **Expected**: You should see "updite" in suggestions (NOT filtered out!)
5. Type "upda"
6. **Expected**: You should see both "update" and "updite" in suggestions
7. **Glide Typing**: Glide "updite" - should work PERFECTLY ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
8. **Manual Selection**: Tap "updite" - should work perfectly ‚ú®
9. **Auto-commit**: Type "updi" and press space - should auto-correct to "update" (NOT "updite")

### 4. Test Dynamic Toggle Behavior:
1. Toggle auto-correct ON/OFF from quick settings
2. **Expected**: Suggestions and glide typing immediately update without needing to restart typing
3. **Expected**: Glide typing works for user words regardless of auto-correct state
4. **Expected**: Only auto-commit behavior changes based on auto-correct state

## Key Benefits of FINAL Implementation

‚úÖ **Perfect Glide Typing**: User words work flawlessly with glide typing in all scenarios  
‚úÖ **Dynamic Updates**: Auto-correct toggle instantly refreshes all typing behaviors  
‚úÖ **Best of Both Worlds**: User words available for suggestions/glide typing, but excluded from auto-commit  
‚úÖ **Seamless Experience**: No broken functionality - everything works as users expect  
‚úÖ **Smart Auto-Correct**: Only auto-commits proper dictionary words, preventing saved typos from interfering  
‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Auto-correct OFF behavior unchanged

## Technical Implementation - FINAL

- **WordSuggestionCandidate**: Added `isFromUserDictionary` property to track word source
- **LatinLanguageProvider**: Always includes user words in `getListOfWords()` for glide typing and suggestions
- **NlpManager**: Auto-commit logic selectively excludes user dictionary words when auto-correct is enabled
- **KeyboardManager**: Toggle auto-correct triggers immediate suggestion refresh for dynamic updates
- **All Providers**: Updated to properly mark user vs dictionary words

## Root Cause Resolution

**Previous Issue**: `getListOfWords()` was being filtered based on auto-correct state, which broke glide typing
**Solution**: Always include user words in `getListOfWords()` but filter them only during auto-commit in `NlpManager`

This ensures glide typing and suggestions always have access to user words while maintaining smart auto-correct behavior! üöÄ

‚úÖ **Glide typing working**: ‚úì  
‚úÖ **Auto-correct working**: ‚úì
