# Auto-Correct Filtering Test Instructions

## What We Implemented

The auto-correct system now uses a **simple filtering approach** instead of complex prioritization:

- **When auto-correct is ENABLED**: Only dictionary words are used for suggestions (user dictionary words are filtered out)
- **When auto-correct is DISABLED**: All words (both dictionary and user words) are available for suggestions

## Testing Steps

### 1. First, add a misspelled word to user dictionary:
1. Type "updite" (misspelled version of "update")
2. When it appears in suggestions, long-press it
3. Select "Add to dictionary" to save it to your personal dictionary

### 2. Test with Auto-Correct DISABLED (default state):
1. Go to Settings → Typing → Auto-correct → Turn OFF auto-correct toggle
2. Type "updi" 
3. **Expected**: You should see "updite" (your saved misspelled word) in suggestions
4. Type "upda"
5. **Expected**: You should see both "update" (dictionary) and "updite" (user word) in suggestions

### 3. Test with Auto-Correct ENABLED:
1. Go to Settings → Typing → Auto-correct → Turn ON auto-correct toggle
2. Type "updi"
3. **Expected**: You should NOT see "updite" (filtered out), only proper dictionary words
4. Type "upda"
5. **Expected**: You should see "update" (dictionary word) but NOT "updite" (filtered out)
6. Type "updi" and press space
7. **Expected**: It should auto-correct to "update" (not "updite")

### 4. Verify Toggle Functionality:
1. Toggle auto-correct ON/OFF from quick settings or main settings
2. **Expected**: Suggestions should immediately change based on toggle state
3. With toggle OFF: User words appear in suggestions
4. With toggle ON: User words are filtered out, only dictionary words appear

## Key Benefits

✅ **Simple Logic**: No complex prioritization algorithms
✅ **Predictable Behavior**: Auto-correct only suggests proper dictionary words
✅ **User Control**: Toggle allows switching between filtered/unfiltered suggestions
✅ **Performance**: Efficient filtering without complex scoring calculations

## Technical Implementation

- `LatinLanguageProvider.kt`: Added preference checking to conditionally exclude user dictionary words
- `NlpManager.kt`: Simplified auto-commit logic that works with filtered suggestions
- Auto-correct toggle integrates seamlessly with the filtering system

This approach ensures that when users enable auto-correct, they only get suggestions from proper dictionaries, preventing accidentally saved misspellings from interfering with corrections.
