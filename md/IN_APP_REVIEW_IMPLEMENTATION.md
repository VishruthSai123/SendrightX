# üì± In-App Review Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This implementation follows Google Play In-App Review API best practices to request user reviews at the optimal moment - immediately after the first 3 successful AI text transformations in the same day.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`InAppReviewManager`** - Main manager handling all review logic
2. **`InAppReviewDebugHelper`** - Debug utilities for testing
3. **Integration in `ActionResultPanel`** - Tracks successful actions

## üìã Implementation Details

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Smart Triggering Logic**
- Triggers immediately after first 3 successful actions in same day
- Works for both free and pro users
- No minimum total actions requirement

‚úÖ **One-Time Show Policy**
- Shows review prompt only once per user lifecycle
- Tracks completion to prevent re-showing
- Handles user declines gracefully

‚úÖ **Edge Case Handling**
- Respects Google Play Review API limitations
- Handles network failures gracefully
- Prevents multiple simultaneous requests
- Rate limits declined attempts

‚úÖ **User Experience Focused**
- Non-intrusive timing (after successful actions)
- Graceful failure handling
- No blocking UI or forced interactions

### Trigger Conditions

The review prompt will show when **ALL** conditions are met:

1. ‚úÖ **Daily Actions**: User accepted 3 AI transformations today
2. ‚úÖ **Not Shown Before**: Review hasn't been requested previously
3. ‚úÖ **Not Completed**: User hasn't completed review already
4. ‚úÖ **Decline Limit**: User hasn't declined more than 2 times
5. ‚úÖ **Time Limit**: At least 7 days since last attempt

## üîß Configuration

### Constants (in `InAppReviewManager`)

```kotlin
private const val REQUIRED_DAILY_ACTIONS = 3        // Actions needed today
private const val MAX_DECLINE_COUNT = 2             // Max user declines
private const val MIN_DAYS_BETWEEN_ATTEMPTS = 7     // Days between retry attempts
```

### SharedPreferences Keys

- `review_requested` - Whether review was ever requested
- `review_completed` - Whether user completed review
- `last_action_date` - Last date user performed action
- `daily_action_count` - Actions performed today
- `total_actions` - Total lifetime actions
- `review_declined_count` - Number of times user declined
- `last_review_attempt` - Timestamp of last review attempt

## üîå Integration Points

### ActionResultPanel Integration

```kotlin
// In acceptText() method after successful text application
val reviewManager = InAppReviewManager.getInstance(context)
reviewManager.recordSuccessfulAction()
```

### Dependencies Added

```kotlin
implementation("com.google.android.play:review:2.0.2")
implementation("com.google.android.play:review-ktx:2.0.2")
```

## üß™ Testing

### Debug Helper Methods

```kotlin
// Log current statistics
InAppReviewDebugHelper.logReviewStats(context)

// Simulate actions to trigger review
InAppReviewDebugHelper.simulateActions(context, 3)

// Force review trigger (testing only)
InAppReviewDebugHelper.forceReviewTrigger(context)

// Reset all data for clean testing
InAppReviewDebugHelper.resetReviewData(context)

// Complete test flow
InAppReviewDebugHelper.testReviewFlow(context)
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Reset Data**: Call `resetReviewData()` 
2. **Simulate Actions**: Use `simulateActions(context, 5)`
3. **Verify Trigger**: Review prompt should appear
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Try declining, network failures, etc.

## üìä Edge Cases Handled

### ‚úÖ User Already Reviewed from Play Store
- Google Play API automatically handles this
- Won't show in-app review if user already rated
- API returns appropriate response

### ‚úÖ Network/API Failures
- Graceful failure handling
- Doesn't block user workflow
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### ‚úÖ Multiple Decline Scenarios
- Tracks decline count
- Rate limits requests after 2 declines
- Minimum 7 days between attempts

### ‚úÖ Context Issues
- Handles keyboard service context properly
- Works without direct Activity reference
- System manages review flow appropriately

### ‚úÖ Race Conditions
- Thread-safe SharedPreferences operations
- Prevents multiple simultaneous requests
- Atomic state updates

## üîí Privacy & Data

### Data Collected
- Daily action counts (local only)
- Review completion status (local only)
- Decline tracking (local only)
- **No personal data sent to external servers**

### Data Storage
- All data stored in local SharedPreferences
- No network transmission of user behavior
- Automatically cleared on app uninstall

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Google Play enforces quota limits on review requests
- Our implementation respects these limits
- Multiple safeguards prevent quota exhaustion

### User Experience
- Non-blocking implementation
- Graceful error handling
- Respects user choices (decline tracking)

### Performance
- Minimal CPU overhead
- Efficient SharedPreferences usage
- No UI blocking operations

## üìà Monitoring

### Success Metrics to Track
- Review completion rate
- Daily active users with 3+ actions
- Time from install to first review prompt
- Review decline patterns

### Debug Logging
All debug logs prefixed with `InAppReview:` for easy filtering:
```
InAppReview: Daily actions: 3
InAppReview: All conditions met, attempting to show review
InAppReview: Successfully got ReviewInfo
InAppReview: Review flow completed
```

## üîÑ Best Practices Followed

1. **Google Play Guidelines**
   - Natural user flow integration
   - No forced or repeated prompts
   - Appropriate timing after positive actions

2. **Android Best Practices**
   - Proper context handling
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Resource cleanup

3. **User Experience**
   - Non-intrusive timing
   - Graceful failure handling
   - Respects user preferences

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Review Not Showing**
- Check debug logs for condition failures
- Verify all trigger conditions are met
- Test with `InAppReviewDebugHelper`

**API Failures**
- Check Google Play Services version
- Verify app is installed from Play Store for production testing
- Review network connectivity

**Testing Issues**
- Use debug helper methods for simulation
- Reset data between test runs
- Check BuildConfig.DEBUG for debug-only features

## üì± Platform Support

- **Minimum SDK**: Android API 21+
- **Google Play Services**: Required
